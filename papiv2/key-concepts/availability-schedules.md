# Availability schedules

The [availability schedules endpoints](../content-ingestion-endpoints/#availability-schedules-endpoints) provide information about the availability of a product (along with its various product options and starting times, if they exist) and its pricing.

This section explains how to interpret the response from the [availability schedules endpoints](../content-ingestion-endpoints/#availability-schedules-endpoints).

Example response snippet from [/availability/schedules/10212P2](../../../openapi/reference/operation/availabilitySchedules/#availability-schedules-endpoints) (some starting times were removed for brevity):

- Each item in the `bookableItems[]` array contains the availability and pricing data for one of the product's product-options (`productOptionCode`).
- Each item in the `seasons[]` array describes the availability and pricing for the product-option during the 'season' (period of time) delimited by `startDate` and `endDate`. If `endDate` is not present, this means the season extends 384 days (approximately 12.5 months) into the future from the current date.
- Each item in the `pricingRecords[]` array describes which days of the week (`daysOfWeek[]`) the availability and pricing data pertains to during the season, as well as which starting times are in operation (`timedEntries[]`) and on which dates (`unavailableDates[]`) each starting time is unavailable (e.g., due to being sold out).
- Each item in the `pricingDetails[]` array describes the pricing that applies to each age-band during the season.

## Interpreting the availability schedule

We can thereby interpret the availability schedule snippet above as follows:

- For the product-option code `"TG45"` of product `"10212P2"`, during the period from `"2019-05-01"` to `"2021-12-31"`, on **all days of the week**, there are starting times at **10:00** and **11:00**.
- The **11:00** starting time is unavailable due to being 'sold out' on the following dates:
  - 2020-09-16
  - 2020-09-22
  - 2020-09-23
  - 2020-09-27
  - 2020-09-29
  - 2020-09-30
- The **10:00** starting time is unavailable due to being 'sold out' on the following dates:
  - 2020-09-25
  - 2020-09-26
  - 2020-09-27
  - 2020-09-28
  - 2020-09-29
  - 2020-09-30
- Infant tickets are free (USD 0)
- Adults are charged per-person; the normal recommended retail price (`original`) is USD 100.02
- A **pricing special** (`special`) is in effect for adults between 2020-08-28 and 2020-09-30; the special recommended retail price is USD 90.02 

Using this information, a complete schedule â€“ including which product-codes and starting times are available on which dates and the pricing (including special discounts) that applies on each date - can be constructed in your database.
