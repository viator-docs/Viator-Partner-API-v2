# Itineraries

The itinerary for a product is used to communicate to customers what to expect with regard to where they will go when participating in the tour or activity. On the [Viator.com website](https://viator.com), this information is displayed in the **What to expect** section on each product's product display page.

Itinerary information is available from this API in a machine-interpretable, structured format that facilitates graphical display and advanced search, should you choose to implement it.

The itinerary information for each product is contained in the `itinerary` object in the response from any of the [product content endpoints](../content-ingestion-endpoints/#product-content-endpoints).

There are five types of itinerary, and the type is specified in the `itinerary.itineraryType` field. They are as follows:

| Itinerary type | `itineraryType` | Meaning |
|----------------|-----------------------|---------|
| <a href="#standard-itinerary">**Standard**</a> | `"STANDARD"` | A tour-based product (focused on visiting and viewing) that occurs at a single location or proceeds through a set of locations on a single day.  |
| <a href="#activity-itinerary">**Activity**</a> | `"ACTIVITY"` | An activity-based product (focused on the activity rather than the location) that occurs at a single location or proceeds through a set of locations on a single day |
| <a href="#multi-day-tour-itinerary">**Multi-day tour**</a> | `"MULTI_DAY_TOUR"` | A tour or activity that occurs over multiple days, and therefore includes food and accommodation |
| <a href="#hop-on--hop-off-itinerary">**Hop-on / hop-off**</a> | `"HOP_ON_HOP_OFF"` | A tour that operates continuously, such as a bus tour, wherein passengers can use their ticket to board and alight as they please at any of the stops along the route |
| <a href="#unstructured-itinerary">**Unstructured**</a> | `"UNSTRUCTURED"` | Not all suppliers have upgraded the itinerary information for their products from a text-based description to structured data; therefore, the itinerary information for a small number of products remains unparseable for the time being. | 

## Common elements

The `itinerary` object is polymorphic depending on the `itineraryType`, but all variants contain standard information, as follows:

| Field name | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `skipTheLine` | `true` if a ticket for this product allows participants to attend a location without having to obtain a separate ticket on the occasion itself |
| `privateTour` | `true` if only the travelers who have booked this product will be present; `false` if it is a shared tour |
| `maxTravelersInSharedTour` | If `privateTour` is `false`, this value represents the maximum number of people that will be able to participate in the tour or activity. |
| `unstructuredDescription` | In the event that structured information is not available, this field will contain a plain-text description of the itinerary. |

All other elements in the `itinerary` object differ slightly according to the value of `itineraryType`.

## Standard itinerary

Products with a `"STANDARD"` itinerary type are tour-based products (focused on visiting and viewing) that occur at a single location or proceed through a set of locations on a single day.

An example of a `"STANDARD"` itinerary product is [Barossa Valley Highlights from Barossa Valley Including Wine and Cheese Tasting (21381P1)](https://www.viator.com/tours/Barossa-Valley/Barossa-Valley-Highlights-from-Adelaide-or-Barossa-Valley-Including-Wine-and-Cheese-Tasting/d5623-21381P1).

The `itinerary` object in the product-content response for this tour is as follows (truncated to the first three items for brevity):

```javascript
"itinerary": {
  "itineraryType": "STANDARD",
  "skipTheLine": false,
  "duration": {
    "fixedDurationInMinutes": 360
  },
  "itineraryItems": [
    {
      "pointOfInterestLocation": {
        "location": {
          "ref": "LOC-5620ab70-c813-4904-ad13-bcf527540d3e"
        },

    },

    },

          "ref": "LOC-9494c4cf-f4e4-4e7f-8213-0cf1b9980097"
        }
      },
      "duration": {
        "fixedDurationInMinutes": 30
      },
      "passByWithoutStopping": false,
      "admissionIncluded": "YES",
      "description": "No trip to the Barossa would be complete without (...)"
    }
    (...)
  ]
}
```
The `itineraryItems[]` array describes the itinerary of locations for this tour and can be used in conjunction with the [/locations/bulk](../../../openapi/reference/operation/locationsBulk) endpoint to contruct a **What to expect** section, similar to what is seen for this product on [viator.com](https://www.viator.com/tours/Barossa-Valley/Barossa-Valley-Highlights-from-Adelaide-or-Barossa-Valley-Including-Wine-and-Cheese-Tasting/d5623-21381P1), as in the following screen-shot:

<figure>
    <img src="../../images/standard-itinerary.png" alt="Standard itinerary example from viator.com"/>
    <figcaption>Standard itinerary example from viator.com</figcaption>
</figure>

The elements highlighted in red boxes are sourced as follows:

**"Stop At: Seppeltsfield"**

The name of each location (in the highlighted case, 'Seppeltsfield') is not included in the response and must be determined by submitting the location reference code in the `pointOfInterestLocation.location.ref` field to the [/locations/bulk](../../../openapi/reference/operation/locationsBulk) endpoint.

The location reference is `"LOC-5620ab70-c813-4904-ad13-bcf527540d3e"`:

```javascript
"pointOfInterestLocation": {
  "location": {
    "ref": "LOC-5620ab70-c813-4904-ad13-bcf527540d3e"
}
```

Submitting this code to the [/locations/bulk](../../../openapi/reference/operation/locationsBulk) endpoint yields the following response:

```javascript
{
  "locations": [
    {
      "provider": "TRIPADVISOR",
      "reference": "LOC-5620ab70-c813-4904-ad13-bcf527540d3e",
      "name": "Seppeltsfield",
      "address": {
        "street": "730 Seppeltsfield Rd",
        "administrativeArea": "Seppeltsfield",
        "state": "South Australia",
        "country": "Australia",
        "countryCode": "AU",
        "postcode": "5355"
      },
      "center": {
        "latitude": -34.489162,
        "longitude": 138.91866
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The name of the location is in the `name` element; i.e., `"Seppeltsfield"`.

**Description**

The description for each itinerary stop is given in the `description` field; in this case:

```javascript
"description": "Guests will experience the majesty of the Seppeltsfield Winery Estate, an historic icon of the Barossa and integral part of its storied history. Learn the story of the Seppelt family, the phenomenal fortified wines upon which they have built their reputation and taste a broad range of their current wine offerings. Donâ€™t forget to ask about the Centennial collection, the only wine collection of wines of its type in the world with more than 120 years of consecutive vintages currently stored in the barrel. "
```

**"Duration: 45 minutes"**

The duration spent at an itinerary location is given in the `duration` element. This can be a fixed duration, as in this example and indicated by the `fixedDurationInMinutes` field being filled; i.e.:

```javascript
"duration": {
  "fixedDurationInMinutes": 45
},
```

Or, the time spent at the location might be variable, in which case only the `variableDurationFromMinutes` and `variableDurationToMinutes` fields will appear; e.g.:

```javascript
"duration": {
  "variableDurationFromMinutes": 10,
  "variableDurationToMinutes": 30
},
```

**"Admission Ticket Included"**

This item of information indicates to the traveler whether or not they will be required to pay for admission to a location or whether admission is included in the price of the tour. It is indicated by the `admissionIncluded` field; which in this case is:

```javascript
  "admissionIncluded": "YES"
```
The possible values this field can take are:
- `"YES"`
- `"NO"`
- `"NOT_APPLICABLE"`

**Pass by without stopping**

In this example, the `passByWithoutStopping` element is `false` for all locations. On some tours, however, the vehicle will merely pass by a certain location, without stopping, for viewing purposes. If that is the case, this field will be `true`.

## Activity itinerary

The "activity" itinerary is designed for products where the focus of the experience is the activity itself (e.g., cooking classes), rather than the location(s) at which it occurs.

The `itinerary` object for this type of product includes the `activityInfo` and `foodMenus` objects, which contain details about the activity and any meals being served (or created), respectively.

**Example activity experience**: [Traditional Cooking Class - 114869P3](https://www.viator.com/tours/Yogyakarta/Traditional-Cooking-Class/d22560-114869P3)

```javascript
"itinerary": {

  "duration": {
    "fixedDurationInMinutes": 240
  },

       "dishDescription": "Braised Chicken in Coconut Milk"
    }
  ]
}
```

All information for the 'What to Expect' section on the product display page on Viator.com is can be sourced from this object.

## Multi-day tour itinerary

Products with a `"MULTI_DAY_TOUR"` itinerary type are tours or activities that occur over multiple days, and therefore include a breakdown of the itinerary for each day of the tour, as well as extra information about food and accommodation.

**Example multi-day tour**: [Active Winter Adventure in Yukon | 5 days (7110P7)](https://www.viator.com/tours/Whitehorse/5-Day-Active-Winter-Adventure-in-Yukon/d5420-7110P7)

Within the `days[]` array, each day of the multi-day tour is described. The `items[]` array within each item of the `days[]` array largely follows the structure of the items in the `itineraryItems[]` array of the `"STANDARD"` itinerary and can be interpreted for display.

**Note**: The example above does not include the `foodAndDrinks[]` element, as it is not relevant to this product.

## Hop-on / hop off itinerary

A hop-on/hop-off product is one that typically operates continuously during its hours of operation, such as a bus tour, and passengers can use their ticket to board and alight as they please at any of the stops along the route.

Such products may also operate multiple routes simultaneously.

**Example hop-on / hop-off tour**:[Big Bus Sydney and Bondi Hop-on Hop-off Tour (5010SYDNEY)](https://www.viator.com/tours/Sydney/Sydney-and-Bondi-Hop-on-Hop-off-Tour/d357-5010SYDNEY)

}
```

By comparing the response snippet with the screenshot above, you can see that:

- There are two routes â€“Â "Red Route - Sydney Icons" and "Blue Route - Bondi Lifestyle"
- The Blue Route has 8 stops and 5 points of interest
- Only the first two stops on the Blue Route have descriptive text entered by the supplier, as seen in the screenshot and in the snippet (`description` field)

All location details (including the name) must be retrieved by sending the location reference to the [/locations/bulk](../../../openapi/reference/operation/locationsBulk) endpoint. 

## Unstructured itinerary

Although our systems have been upgraded to support structured itinerary information, this feature is only availabe once the supplier manually updates their product details. A small number of suppliers have not yet made these updates. As such, some products retain their legacy itinerary information, and this case is handled with the `"UNSTRUCTURED"` itinerary type.
