# Viator Partner-API v2

## What is it?

The Viator Partner API v2 comprises a set of endpoints that can support the operation of a fully-featured tours and experiences booking website or application; or, it can be integrated with your existing travel-booking software.

The API exposes a variety of services that allow the retrieval of all product details, such as descriptive text and structured metadata, pricing, terms and conditions, photos and reviews.

The API allows product content, pricing and availability data to be retrieved in bulk or queried in real-time, it can perform pricing calculations according to the number and type of traveler and product option combinations available, and it supports availability and pricing holds as part of its booking and booking-cancellation functionality. 

## Who is it for?

The Viator Partner-API is a designed for use by organizations partnered with Viator as [Affiliate partners](https://partnerresources.viator.com/travel-commerce/affiliate/) or [Merchant partners](https://partnerresources.viator.com/travel-commerce/merchant/).

### Affiliate partners


Affiliate partners have full access to the areas of the API relating to content, but sales of Viator products must be carried out on the Viator site itself. 

When a customer wishes to book a product from an affiliate's site, they are instead redirected to the relevant product page on [viator.com](https://viator.com) via a unique URL in order to complete the purchase. Once on the Viator site, a cookie is set such that all transactions will accrue a commission for that partner until the cookie expires.

Purchases of products originating from the affiliate's site are recorded and a commission on these sales is paid periodically.

### Merchant partners

The merchant partner relationship is one in which the partner is the **merchant of record**; i.e., the partner takes full responsibility for all financial records and transactions carried out by their users, as well as providing customer support with regard to providing general assistance, processing cancellations and refunds, and liaising between suppliers and customers when the need to communicate arises.
