    Get user-submitted reviews of a product

    - **Note**: This endpoint uses conventions from V1 of this API. See
    [V1 endpoints](../../../../papiv2/key-concepts/v1-endpoints) for further
    information

    - Only reviews in the language specified in the Accept-Language request
    header parameter will be returned. The value given in `totalCount` represents the total 
    number of reviews for this product across all languages. Therefore, the number 
    of reviews you can access may be fewer than this value for the language you specify.


    **Example:** "Get the first three reviews for product `5010SYDNEY` sorted by
    rating in ascending order":


    ```javascript

    https://viatorapi.sandbox.viator.com/service/product/reviews?sortOrder=REVIEW_RATING_A&topX=1-3&code=5010SYDNEY&showUnavailable=false

    ```

    For information about how to find the review count and average rating, see: [Determining ratings](#section/Workflows/Determining-ratings)
