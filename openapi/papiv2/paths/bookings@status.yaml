    **Note**: This endpoint is only available to <u>merchant partners</u>.


    Requests the status of an existing booking using either the Viator-generated
    booking reference (`bookingRef`) or the reference generated by the partner
    (`partnerBookingRef`).


    Checking the status of a booking is only necessary for [manual-confirmation products](../../../../papiv2/booking-concepts/booking-confirmation-types), and should only be called intermittently, no more than once every 3 minutes.
