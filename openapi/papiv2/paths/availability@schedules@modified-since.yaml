  operationId: availabilitySchedulesModifiedSince
  parameters:
    - name: cursor
      in: query
      description: |
        Pagination cursor received from a previous call to **this** endpoint that
        points to the desired starting point for the results.

        **Note**: Pagination will come into play when the number of results
        exceeds the figure given in the `count` parameter. In this case, pass
        the content of the `nextCursor` element for the value of `cursor` to
        receive the next page of results. The final page of results will not
        include the `nextCursor` element. For more information, see: [Ingesting
        and updating availability schedules](../../../../papiv2/workflows/ingesting-and-updating-availability-schedules).
        - Example: `'MTYwNTA2ODAwOXw1NjcyUDk='`
      required: false
      schema:
        type: string
    - name: count
      in: query
      description: |
        The maximum number of products to be returned in response. 
        - Maximum allowed and default value: `500`
      required: false
      schema:
        type: integer
        minimum: 1
        maximum: 500
    - name: modified-since
      in: query
      description: >
        Only retrieve schedule that have alterations to their details since this
        date and time.

        - Format: `'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSSZ'`

        - Example: `"2020-09-30T00%3A00%3A01.737043Z"` (URL-encoded)


        **Notes**: 

        - You **must** submit the time-stamp in its <u>URL-encoded format</u>

        - Using this parameter is <u>not recommended</u> as the standard pagination method; rather, use the `cursor` parameter to ensure all availability updates are captured during ingestion.
