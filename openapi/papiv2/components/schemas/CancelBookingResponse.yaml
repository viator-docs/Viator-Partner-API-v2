      Booking reference code for this booking

        - **Note**: For bookings made with v1 of this API, this code corresponds to `data.itemSummaries[].itemId` (in the response from v1's [/booking/book](https://docs.viator.com/partner-api/merchant/technical/#tag/Booking-services/paths/~1booking~1book/post) endpoint) but prepended with `BR-`. For example, if the `itemId` is `580669678`, this field should be `BR-580669678`.
