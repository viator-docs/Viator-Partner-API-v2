      overviewSummary: >-
        <div style="">If you’re into American cars, it doesn’t get much better
        than Las Vegas’ Shelby Heritage Center, the brainchild of race car
        driver Carroll Shelby. Shelby American is behind the AC Cobra, and has
        churned out premier performance versions of Mustangs and other cars. Now
        fans can check out many of the company’s creations.</div><div
        style=""><br></div><div style=""><b>The Basics</b></div><div
        style="">Opened in 2014, the Shelby Heritage Center includes the
        factory, a museum, and a gift shop. Find out more about the specialty
        car manufacturer’s history and founder, and get up close to many of the
        cars—including classic Mustangs, the very first Shelby Cobra, and more
        recent productions. Tours include a visit to the factory, where an area
        is sectioned off for viewing.&nbsp;</div><div style=""><br></div><div
        style=""><b>Things to Know Before You Go</b></div><div
        style=""><ul><li>The Shelby Heritage Center is a must for car
        enthusiasts and historians.</li><li>Don’t confuse the Shelby Heritage
        Center with the Shelby American Collection in Boulder, Colorado—the
        latter features cars donated by owners and
        collectors.</li></ul></div><div style=""><br></div><div style=""><b>How
        to Get There</b></div><div style="">Located adjacent to Interstate 15 in
        Las Vegas, the Shelby Heritage Center is about 10 minutes away from the
        Strip by car. Taxis and rideshares are readily available.</div><div
        style=""><br></div><div style=""><b>When to Get There</b></div><div
        style="">The center is open daily, and guided tours are offered every
        day but Sunday. If you’re an early riser, get there Saturday morning for
        the weekly Cars and Coffee event, featuring breakfast food trucks and
        giveaways. Spring and fall typically see the most pleasant weather—and
        the biggest crowds.</div><div style=""><br></div><div style=""><b>Drive
        a Race Car in Las Vegas</b></div><div style="">If looking at cars isn’t
        enough, head to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway to learn how to maneuver a
        Ferrari, a Porsche, or maybe a Lamborghini. Get a lesson in the proper
        driving position, steering techniques, car specs, and racing lines.
        Then, take several laps around the track on your own.</div>

        <p>Inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino is the Shark Reef Aquarium,
        showcasing more than 2,000 animals displayed in 14 different exhibits
        and almost 1.6 million gallons of water.</p><p>
         
        The Shark Reef Aquarium was designed to be a “total sensory experience,”
        and part of that is achieved by leading visitors through an acrylic
        tunnel with water nearly surrounding them. This exhibit alone includes
        15 different species of sharks along with all the other sea life in the
        tank.</p><p>
         
        Other species in the aquarium include golden crocodiles, sea turtles and
        piranhas, none of which are included in the touching pools where
        visitors can find out what some of the other sea creatures feel
        like.</p>
      overviewSummary: >-
        <div style="">Get up close and personal with some of the most fearsome
        creatures of the deep at Mandalay Bay’s Shark Reef Aquarium. Designed to
        be a total sensory experience—with two underwater tunnels and multiple
        tanks and exhibits—the aquarium is home to more than 2,000 animals,
        including many species of sharks.</div><div style=""><br></div><div
        style=""><b>The Basics</b></div><div style="">Wander through a viewing
        tunnel at the Shark Reef Aquarium’s largest exhibit, a shipwreck
        surrounded by 1.3 million gallons (4.9 million liters) of water. In
        addition to sharks, you’ll see salt- and freshwater fish, as well as sea
        turtles, golden crocodiles, giant rays, and more. The touch pool is a
        favorite among younger visitors, while certified divers have the
        opportunity to scuba dive in the tanks.</div><div
        style=""><br></div><div style="">Admission to the aquarium is included
        in some multi-attraction Las Vegas sightseeing passes.</div><div
        style=""><br></div><div style=""><b>Things to Know Before You
        Go</b></div><div style=""><ul><li>Most visitors spend around 45 to 60
        minutes at the Shark Reef Aquarium.</li><li>An audio guide is available
        in English and Spanish.</li><li>Guests staying at the Mandalay Bay
        Resort can watch the Shark Reef channel on TV.</li></ul></div><div
        style=""><br></div><div style=""><b>How to Get There</b></div><div
        style="">The Shark Reef Aquarium is located near the South Convention
        Center in the Mandalay Bay Resort, at the southern end of Las Vegas
        Boulevard. You can easily get to the resort by car, taxi, shuttle, or
        the free Excalibur–Luxor–Mandalay Bay tram.&nbsp;</div><div
        style=""><br></div><div style=""><b>When to Get There</b></div><div
        style="">The aquarium is open daily, usually with extended hours on
        weekends and over the summer. Last entry is an hour before closing.
        There’s no set schedule for animal feedings, but they often take place
        between 10am and 4pm.</div><div style=""><b><br></b></div><div
        style=""><b>Aquariums in Las Vegas</b></div><div style="">Las Vegas has
        more than 10 aquariums, some of which can be found inside casinos.
        Besides the Shark Reef, check out these other popular aquariums: the
        Tank at the Golden Nugget, SeaQuest Las Vegas, the Aquarium at the
        Silverton Hotel, and the Atlantis Aquarium at the Forum Shops at Caesars
        Palace.</div>
