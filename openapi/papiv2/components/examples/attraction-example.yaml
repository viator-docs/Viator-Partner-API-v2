          <p>It's worth going to the Shark Reef Aquarium. It's spectacular and
          very educational. The beauty of the ocean is incomparable. You get to
          feel as if you're under the sea. The bonus of using your ticket to
          enter the Mandalay Beach Pool<br/>

          Is a definite plus. Great experience fabulous time!</p>

          <p>Small aquarium but spectacular.  You see the sea life close up. One
          section the fish SWIM over you. This was the first time that I have
          been able to see shark teeth.  All of the animals seem healthy.  This
          aquarium is great for children but adults like it as well.</p>

          <p>This was the highlight tour while in Vegas! Mandalay Bay Hotel is
          by far the best landscaped grounds on The Strip and the staff was
          wonderful.  We went on a Wednesday afternoon and the line was short
          but the sea life was long.  From the golden crocodile, to the glowing
          jelly fish and the incredible walk-under-the-sea through the curved
          glass tunnel, this was a simply amazing aquarium!</p>

          <p>There are some negative reviews around, but we thought it was
          great. Yes it's not huge but I'm not sure what people expect. It's
          well done and it is impressive. My kids loved seeing all in here, but
          especially the sharks and jellyfish. And the discounted price using
          viator was excellent compared to the 'on the door' price. We went
          around 8pm and it was quite quiet and not packed</p>

          <p>It is a great place to see some great ocean and river Critters. If
          you show up at the right time, you can watch them feed the animals and
          not to mention the touch pool with Stingrays,horseshoe crabs. Great
          for all ages and you go at your own speed so you can watch the
          jellyfish or see the sharks in a shipwreck!!</p>

          <p>My husband and I often check out aquariums in our travels.  This
          was better than others in this country that we've seen.  It wasn't
          huge, but what it had to show, it certainly did and in a great way! 
          We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!</p>

          <p>When we went to the Shark Reef, there were not a lot of people.  I
          hear it can get crowded.  It was awesome because some trainers were
          answering questions about the caged creatures.  The hands on sting
          ray/ horseshoe crab area was a HUGE hit!  You can touch these things
          and learn a lot about them from the trained staff member that is there
          to answer any questions you may have.   The shark display is neat, as
          you surround them and they surround you.</p>

      <p>Inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino is the Shark Reef Aquarium,
      showcasing more than 2,000 animals displayed in 14 different exhibits and
      almost 1.6 million gallons of water.</p><p>
       
      The Shark Reef Aquarium was designed to be a “total sensory experience,”
      and part of that is achieved by leading visitors through an acrylic tunnel
      with water nearly surrounding them. This exhibit alone includes 15
      different species of sharks along with all the other sea life in the
      tank.</p><p>
       
      Other species in the aquarium include golden crocodiles, sea turtles and
      piranhas, none of which are included in the touching pools where visitors
      can find out what some of the other sea creatures feel like.</p>
